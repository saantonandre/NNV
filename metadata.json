    "description":"A work-in-progress project, aimed to display through a GUI the neural network learning process. This 'vanilla' model was initially inpired by the series '10: Neural Networks - The Nature of Code', by the professor Daniel Shiffman. This model though, implements unconventional abstractions for the sole purpose of graphical rendering, in the expense of computational efficiency.",

    "instructions":"The hidden layers depth and quantity can only be edited through the code, for more informations refer to the main repository at 'https://github.com/saantonandre/NNV'.",

# Neural Network Visualization

A work-in-progress project, aimed to display the neural network process through a graphical interface.
This model was initially inpired by the series "10: Neural Networks - The Nature of Code", by the professor Daniel Shiffman.

This model though, implements unconventional abstractions for the sole purpose of graphical rendering in the expenses of computational efficiency.
